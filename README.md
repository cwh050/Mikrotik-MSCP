With this configuration, the Master is at 192.168.1.2:50000. There are two peers at this site: Peer1 192.168.1.3:50001 and Peer2 192.168.1.4:50002.
The Rest Channel/Site IP must be 192.168.1.100:55000.
IP Remote Programming is also possible but the Device programmer must be configured to use TCP ports 50000 to 50100 (which ought to be the default).
